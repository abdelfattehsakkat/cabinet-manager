# CabinetAI Application Updates

## Overview of Changes

This update includes several improvements to the CabinetAI application:

1. **MongoDB Docker Integration**: Added Docker Compose configuration for MongoDB to simplify setup and improve portability.
2. **Patient Name Display Fix**: Fixed the issue with "undefined undefined" being shown as patient names in the appointment dialog.
3. **Appointment Data Model Enhancement**: Modified the appointment schema to store patient first name and last name directly in appointment documents.

## How to Use MongoDB with Docker

A Docker Compose configuration has been added to simplify the MongoDB setup:

1. Start MongoDB using Docker:
   ```
   ./start-mongodb-docker.sh
   ```

2. MongoDB will be accessible at: `mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017/cabinetdb?authSource=admin`

3. The data will be persisted in a Docker volume, so you won't lose your data when stopping the container.

## Data Migration

A migration script has been provided to update existing appointments with patient names:

1. Run the migration script:
   ```
   cd backend
   ./src/scripts/run-migration.sh
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Connect to MongoDB
   - Find all appointments without patient name fields
   - Fetch patient details and add first/last names to the appointments
   - Update the appointments in the database

## Backward Compatibility

The application has been updated to maintain backward compatibility with existing data:

1. The frontend components will work with both new and old appointment formats
2. A utility method `getPatientFullName()` has been added to the AppointmentService to handle different data formats
3. All components have been updated to use this method for displaying patient names

## Technical Details

### Appointment Schema Changes

The appointment schema now includes:
- `patientFirstName`: String - First name of the patient
- `patientLastName`: String - Last name of the patient

These fields are populated when creating or updating appointments, which eliminates the need to join with the patients collection to display patient names.

### API Changes

- The appointment API now returns appointment objects with patient names directly included
- No changes to API endpoints or request formats were needed
- Existing code using the API should continue to work without modifications
